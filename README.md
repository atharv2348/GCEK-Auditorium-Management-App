# GCEK Auditorium Management App
The GCEK Auditorium Management App is a Flutter-based application designed to simplify the auditorium booking process at Government College of Engineering, Karad (GCEK). By digitizing the booking system, this app allows students, club coordinators, and higher authorities to manage event bookings efficiently, reducing the need for lengthy offline processes.

## Purpose
The app addresses the need for a streamlined, digital process to book the college auditorium for events. Previously, auditorium bookings required multiple steps and manual approval, but with this app, the entire process is conducted online, making it faster and more accessible for everyone involved.

## User Roles & Functionality
**Student**: Receives notifications about scheduled events.  
**Club Coordinator**: Can create requests to book the auditorium for events.  
**Higher Authorities**: Can review, accept, or reject booking requests. Once approved, the event is scheduled, and an email notification is sent to all registered students.  

## Features
**Digital Booking Requests**: Club coordinators can submit booking requests through the app, specifying event details and preferred dates.  
**Admin Review and Approval**: Higher authorities receive requests, review event details, and either approve or reject the booking.  
**Email Notifications**: Upon approval, registered students receive an email notification with event details, including the date and venue. But if higer authorities rejects the request, rejection email will be sent to the request sender.   
**User Authentication**: Secure login for students, coordinators, and higher authorities to access their specific roles.
